# Berlin Startup Map ðŸ¦„
[Explore the startup scene in Berlin live. Now! ðŸ”Ž](https://lohluc.github.io/berlin-startup-map/)

This is an interactive map of startups in Berlin by using the Google Maps API. Each marker shows location information and social media accounts of each startup. The startup list in the navigation section can be searched for specific startup names by using the [knockout.js framework](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html).
With the three buttons in the bottom right corner of the map, you can choose between zoom in, zoom out or reset the map to default zoom.
The map is responsive and fits perfectly on every screen size.

### Run the application

1. Clone the repository by using GIT or download the file.
2. Open the index.html in your browser (**You need a working internet connection because it draws information from Google Maps**).
